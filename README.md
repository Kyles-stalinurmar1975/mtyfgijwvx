I just walked out of watching The Alto Knights, and I’m not even sure where to start. It’s one of those movies where you’re not sure if it was brilliant or a total mess. Or both? Maybe that's what they wanted it to be. I don’t know. My brain feels like a scrambled egg right now.

The plot... was there a plot? I mean, there were knights. On horses, whispering like they knew you secretly wanted a nap but they also wanted to keep you awake with all those strange plot detours. Honestly, watching it felt a bit like being stuck in a dream where you’re lost in an endless mall with no exit signs. Were the Alto Knights protecting something important? Couldn’t tell ya. But they sure looked very serious about it.

> And the soundtrack! Whoever thought that a bagpipe-infused electro-jazz would be a good idea for a medieval film deserves both an award and a slap on the wrist. At first, it’s like, okay, that’s different. Then it’s like, why is this happening TO ME? Yet, in the end, you start bobbing your head against your will, like when your uncle tries out DJ-ing at a family reunion.

Visually, it was stunning. Or maybe I was just dazzled by the superfluity of chain mail and velvet capes. Who knew knights were so fashionable? Of course, the color grading was, uh, let’s say, very creative. Everything was drenched in this weird muddy green like the whole kingdom had a permanent bad-weather day. It’s like someone tried to film it through a forest’s worth of moss. Makes you wonder what their budget was spent on. Capes? Definitely capes.

The acting was... full of choices. Every time Sir Whatever gave one of his meaningful speeches, I leaned over to the person next to me — who I didn't know, by the way — and muttered, “What is happening?” I mean, kudos for committing, though. It’s more than I do most Mondays. Maybe it's one of those movies you have to download and watch a second time to really “get”.

```python
class AltoKnights:
    def __init__(self, wisdom, courage):
        self.wisdom = wisdom
        self.courage = courage

def battle():
    knights = AltoKnights(12, lots)
    print(knights.wisdom + knights.courage)

battle()
```

Anyway, if you decide to watch the movie, bring snacks. Not because you’ll be bored (well, maybe), but because it’s like a rollercoaster ride through someone’s medieval fever dream, and you’ll need the energy. The Alto Knights is like a wild, untamed garden—it’s growing all the wrong things, but you can’t help but wander through it, curious about what you might stumble upon next.
